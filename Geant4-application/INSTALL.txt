This is a standard Geant4 application - see Geant4 Application Developers Guide,
Section 2.8. How to Make an Executable Program.

Make sure it runs with your installed Geant4 libraries.

Copy special versions of some Geant4 source files into your Geant4 source tree.

# Tailor these to your own directory structure:
g4source=/Users/johna/Geant4/geant4-10-05/source
changes=/Users/johna/Geant4/Entanglement/tangle2/geant4.10.5-changes

# Then define
files="\
processes/management/sources.cmake \
processes/management/include/G4ProcessTable.hh \
processes/management/include/G4ProcessTable.icc \
processes/management/include/G4ProcessTableMessenger.hh \
processes/management/include/G4EntanglementAuxInfo.hh \
processes/management/include/G4VEntanglementClipBoard.hh \
processes/management/include/G4JPZeroMinusGammaGammaEntanglementClipBoard.hh \
processes/management/src/G4ProcessTable.cc \
processes/management/src/G4ProcessTableMessenger.cc \
processes/electromagnetic/standard/src/G4eplusAnnihilation.cc \
processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy/src/G4LivermorePolarizedComptonModel.cc \
processes/decay/sources.cmake \
processes/decay/include/G4PionZeroDecay.hh \

# Then
for i in $files
do
cp $changes/$i $g4source/$i
done

Then run cmake again ("cmake .") and make.

========================================================

The following is for advanced developers who want to copy changes in the Geant4
source tree back into tangle2, with a view to updating the git repository.

g4source=/Users/johna/Geant4/Entanglement/geant-entanglement/geant4-dev/source
changes=/Users/johna/Geant4/Entanglement/tangle2/geant4.10.6-changes
tests=/Users/johna/Geant4/Entanglement/geant-entanglement/geant4-dev/tests

#A - Between g4source and changes...

# files as above

# Normal case - transfer from Geant4 to tangle2
a=$g4source
b=$changes
# When setting up Geant4 from tangle2
a=$changes
b=$g4source

----------------------------------------------

#B - Between tangle2 itself and geant4-entanglement/geant4-dev.git

files="*txt LICENSE *mac whist.pl tangle2.cc include/*hh src/*cc"

# Normal case - transfer from Geant4 to tangle2
a=$tests/tangle2
b=./
# When setting up Geant4 from tangle2
a=./
b=$tests/tangle2

---------------------------------------------

# First check for differences:
for i in $files
do
diff -q $a/$i $b/$i >/dev/null || \
opendiff $a/$i $b/$i
done

# If all's well
for i in $files
do
cp $a/$i $b/$i
done
